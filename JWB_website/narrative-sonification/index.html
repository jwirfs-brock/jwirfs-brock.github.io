            <p class="lead">What might it be like to interface with the world—traversing between personal, local, and global issues—untethered from screens and with a deep capacity to listen to data? Imagine:</p>

            <p class="small_text">You wake up and ask your voice assistant for your daily sound dispatch. First, it plays the sound of someone tossing and turning. You recognize this auditory icon because you’ve heard it before, weeks ago, when your voice assistant explained that it meant you had a restless night of sleep.</p>

<p class="small_text">Next, instead of telling you your resting heart rate, your voice assistant plays a heartbeat pulse. You tap your finger to the beat: it feels faster than normal. So, as you finish brushing your teeth, you ask how many beats per minute. “60 bpms,” it responds. “Would you like to hear last night’s resting heart rate compared with the past month’s average?” You say sure, and hear two overlapping, syncopated rhythms—with different sound qualities—and reflect on how rapid the new heart rate sounds.</p>

<p class="small_text">Heading to the kitchen, you ask “Can you play my heart rate trends leading up to the last three times I got sick?” Listening as you scramble some eggs, you notice how quickly your heart rate changed in the past, so you ask your voice assistant to zoom in on the two days before the last time you got sick. It does, and plays the tones again. You say, “That doesn’t sound like this time. Note that I don’t have any symptoms at the moment.” </p>

<p class="small_text">While you eat breakfast, your voice assistant says it has new county and state Covid-19 cases data as part of your daily sound dispatch. You hear a smoothly rising crescendo that gets louder over several seconds, which you’ve learned means that cases have begun increasing again. When you first heard the Covid-19 data, you remember it was presented as discrete pings—but as your voice assistant coached you how to listen, you figured out together that a continuous representation is easier for you to understand. As you put your dishes in the sink, you say, “Can you ask me again this evening if I have any symptoms?” Your voice assistant confirms that it will.</p>
